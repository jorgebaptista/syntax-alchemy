# ⚗️ Syntax Alchemy

**Transmuting syntax into meaning.**  
A growing collection of experimental interpreters, compilers, and language design studies — where abstract syntax is melted, purified, and reshaped into executable form.

Each project within *Syntax Alchemy* explores a new transformation:

- From high-level languages to machine code
- From expressions to evaluation
- From grammar to semantics

Welcome to the lab — where logic meets imagination.
